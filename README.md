# Welcome to my Github!👩🏻‍💻 

<strong> I am a Front-End Developer & active self-learner. </strong>Have a look around my Master Index to see what I've worked on previously. I am currently working on a project which incorporates JavaScript & API to retrieve bytes of music upon search. I will also be collaborating with a peer in a few weeks to develop a kids game app to be completed by the end of 2020.
